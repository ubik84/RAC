      <p>We would like to provide young players, aged from 6 to 14, with an opportunity to develop, learning new techniques and skills, all under the guidance of our coaching staff.
We offer something different and something unique by developing players both on and off the pitch, educating them through experiences that will shape their progression into young adults and giving them skills that can be used throughout their lives.
Wherever you are lucky enough to attend a LFC coaching programme we hope you have fun and enjoy learning how to play ‘The Liverpool Way’.</p>
